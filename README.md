# MassDeleteRoleDiscordBot
A bot that simply mass-deletes a role in your Discord server.
Setup:
- After TOKEN= put your bot token there.
- Install requirements.txt.
- Execute main.py

This bot simply allows you to delete a role if there's multiple of the same role. E.g. if someone made a role called 'egg' 99 times during a raid, use this bot and execute the command /massdeleterole egg, which will delete all the roles that contain 'egg'. The code is available if you want to fork it or anything like that.
